            <p className="my-4">
              6.1 <strong> Fees. </strong> There may be fees payable for the
              provision of the Services (“Fees”), which may be based on
              transactions, access to, or usage of the Services. Any Fees
              payable shall be described to you in advance on the Services. Fees
              to access and use the Services may change from time to time and

              6.2 <strong> Blockchain Fees. </strong> Transactions on
              blockchains require verification and processing by third parties
              that charge a fee for their services (<strong>“Gas Fees”</strong>
              ). Gas Fees are volatile and differ based on a variety of factors
              including the blockchain selected and the network's activity
              levels at the time of the proposed transaction on that blockchain.
              Every time you perform a transaction on the Services you will need
              to pay Gas Fees. These Gas Fees are not paid to Sygma. You are
              solely responsible for the payment of any Gas Fees for
              transactions that occur on the Services.

            <p className="my-4">
              13.1 <strong>Assumption of Risk.</strong> You understand and agree
              that you assume the following risks:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Asset Prices are Volatile.</strong>Market prices
                (in the event of there being a market available) for digital
                assets are extremely volatile. They are subjective and fluctuate
                based on various factors. These market prices could materially
                and adversely affect the value of digital assets you own,
                including any digital asset purchased, sold or transferred on
                the Services. There is no guarantee any digital asset you own
                has or will retain any value. You understand that you may lose
                money on the purchase of a digital asset and that any currency
                your purchase may potentially become worthless. You acknowledge
                Sygma cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or potential
                losses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Software-Based Assets Have Associated Risks.</strong>
                Assets that can only be accessed through physical hardware,
                specialized software, and the internet, have inherent risks.
                These risks include, but are not limited to: (a) the risk of
                hardware failure / malfunction: (b) the risk of software relied
                upon containing bugs, issues or critical vulnerabilities; (c)
                the risk of your internet connection dropping at any time or
                being unsecure; (d) the risk of accessing software-based assets
                containing malicious software or being introduced to malicious
                software; and (e) the risk of third parties obtaining
                unauthorized access and control of information, data of any
                software-based assets stored in your digital wallet, your
                account or elsewhere. Sygma will not be responsible to you for
                any of these, however they are caused.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Assets Rely on External Blockchains. </strong>
                Digital assets listed or made accessible on the Services exist
                on third-party blockchains. Upgrades, modifications, forks, or
                other changes to the general operations of the blockchains
                underlying the digital assets may have material or adverse
                effects on them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty. </strong>Laws and
                regulations governing blockchains, NFTs and other forms of
                digital assets are uncertain and constantly evolving. New laws,
                regulations, policies, orders or guidance may have a material or
                adverse effect on: (i) your ability / eligibility to access the
                Services; (ii) your digital asset or NFT; or (iii) the
                blockchain underlying the digital asset or NFT. Changes to laws
                and regulations in any jurisdiction may affect the utility,
                usability or value of any digital asset or NFT purchased on the
                Services. No central bank, regulator or government backs digital
                assets. Digital assets are not legal tender in most
                jurisdictions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Taxes are Your Responsibility. </strong>
                You are solely responsible for determining what taxes (if any)
                apply to any transaction you perform on the Services. Sygma is
                not responsible for determining the tax consequences that apply
                for any transaction you perform on the Services.

                  Digital Assets and NFTs are Created by Third Parties.
                </strong>
                NFTs and digital assets made accessible on the Services may
                contain, display or include content created by third parties
                (“Third-Party Content”). Sygma does not inspect, monitor, or
                screen NFTs or digital assets that contain Third-Party Content.
                You acknowledge that Third-Party Content could include items
                that: (i) are illegal; (ii) are indecent; (iii) are mislabeled;
                (iv) are counterfeit; (v) have defects with their underlying
                software; (vi) contain malicious code; and (vii) are rendered
                untransferable. Sygma is not responsible for evaluating NFTs or
                digital assets for their content, accuracy, completeness,
                validity, legality, intellectual property rights compliance,
                quality, or compliance with representations made to induce a
                sale. You accept responsibility for carrying out inspections and
                researching on your own the validity of representations made for
                any NFT or digital asset offered for sale on the Services. Sygma
                will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any
                third-party for any Third-Party Content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use of Public Blockchains.</strong>Sygma does not
                control the blockchains or the associated technologies you may
                interact with when using the Services. When you engage in
                transactions on the Services, any purchase, sale or transfer you
                engage in occurs on the applicable blockchain and not on the
                Services. NFTs and other digital assets exist and are
                transferred based on ownership records maintained on the
                relevant blockchain. The Services do not save, store, send,
                receive or host the digital assets that may be transacted with.
                Since public blockchain transactions are generally irreversible,
                Sygma has no ability and will not attempt to reverse any
                transactions that occur on a public blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers.</strong>
                The Services rely on third-party software and service providers.
                These include the digital wallet provider you access the
                Services through, any blockchains relied upon, and the services
                of any third-party otherwise in providing the Services. Sygma
                does not make any promises or guarantees that there will be: (i)
                continued availability or use of those service providers or (ii)
                that they will adequately protect, store or make safe any data
                or information you provide to them. The Services may be
                adversely affected if there are compatibility or other issues
                that make these service providers unable to communicate with the
                Services for an extended period of time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content May be Removed from the Services. </strong>
                Sygma does not screen or investigate content created by third
                parties that may be accessed by you on the Services. Sygma
                reserves the right to blacklist smart contracts, NFTs and other
                digital assets that Sygma reasonably believes may violate this
                Agreement. Any digital assets you may purchase or transfer on
                the Services may become inaccessible on the Services. Under no
                circumstances shall your inability to access or view any digital
                assets purchased or transferred on the Services give rise to any
                kind of claim against Sygma.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transactions with Third-Parties. </strong>Sygma is not
                responsible for any transaction that occurs between you and a
                third-party (as an example your purchase transfer of a digital
                asset to a third-party on a third-party service or “secondary
                market”). Sygma shall have no liability to you or a third-party
                in connection with such transaction. If you have a dispute with
                any third-party on the Services, you release Sygma from any and
                all claims or damages arising out of or in any way connected
                with a dispute.

              17.11. <strong>Severability and Waiver. </strong>
              This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or
              unenforceability of any term or provision shall not affect the
              validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other term or
              provision in this Agreement. Should any term or provision of this
              Agreement be declared void or unenforceable by any court of
              competent jurisdiction, the Parties intend that a substitute
              provision will be added to this Agreement so that, to the greatest
              extent possible, the substitute provision achieves the intended
              commercial outcome of the original provision. Any failure of
              either Party to enforce any rights granted to it hereunder or to
              take action against the other Party in the event of any breach
              hereunder will not be deemed a waiver by that Party as to
              subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the
              event of future breaches.
